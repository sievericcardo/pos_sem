 *  pos_sem
 * 
 *  As part of the Operating System project, in which I had to use System V
 *  semaphores, this library has been created to simulate a simple POSIX semaphore
 *  system using System V. This lets the user to use POSIX function while using
 *  System V semaphores.
 *  This is good since the developer will not need many lines of code while
 *  creating or working with semaphores as he normally would.
 *  The function name are the same as POSIX to ensure maximum easiness, and
 *  the type sem_t has been defined in the header file so that the firm of the
 *  function is the same as POSIX.
